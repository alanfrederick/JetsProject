## Jets Project

## Week 2 project for Skill Distillery

###### Project Description
This is a small creation of an airport that stores aircraft.  The aircraft can be loaded and unloaded, as well as fly.  

###### Technologies used
Used OOP to link different objects to the aiport, as well as an array to hold the specific planes.

###### Lessons learned

Solidified a basic understanding of using OOP.  Struggling with adding new objects to an array with user input, as well as comparing a specific
objects value (in this case speed and distance) in an array and outputting the highest or lowest values.
